Purpose of the code:
The function twoSum checks if there are two numbers in the given array (arr) that add up to the target. If such a pair exists, it returns true (or 1), otherwise, it returns false (or 0).

Steps in the code:

Sorting the array: The array is sorted to make it easier to find pairs using two pointers.
Using two pointers:
left starts at the beginning of the array, and right starts at the end.

Logic:
If the sum of arr[left] and arr[right] equals target, return true.
If their sum is less than target, move the left pointer right to increase the sum.
If their sum is greater than target, move the right pointer left to decrease the sum.
This process continues until left and right pointers meet.
If no pair is found, return false.
